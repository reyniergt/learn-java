## Implement the interfaces Queue and Stack.

1. Stack represents a collection of elements with LIFO behaviour (_last element to be added will be the first element to be removed_)
2. Queue represents a collection of elements with FIFO behaviour (_first element to be added will be the first element to be removed_)
3. Make sure all tests pass (_You must update the tests in order to instantiate the stack and queue objects in every case_)
