# Inheritance
## Abstract classes and interfaces

In this package are defined three interfaces _Runner_, _Flyer_ and _Swimmer_ with methods _run()_, _fly()_ and _swim()_ respectively.

Goals:

1. Implement classes Dog and Cat that must be able to run.
2. Implement classes Hawk and Pidgeon that must be able to fly.
3. Implement classes Dolphin and Shark that must be able to swim.
4. Ensure that common behaviour is not duplicated.
5. Implement a Dragon class that must be able to run, fly and swim.
